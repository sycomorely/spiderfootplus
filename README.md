ABOUT
------

SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. Its goal is to automate the process of gathering intelligence about a given target, which may be an IP address, domain name, hostname, network subnet, ASN, e-mail address or person's name.

SpiderFoot can be used offensively, i.e. as part of a black-box penetration test to gather information about the target, or defensively to identify what information you or your organisation are freely providing for attackers to use against you.
