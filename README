INSTALLING AND RUNNING ON *NIX
===============================

SpiderFoot is written in Python (2.7), so to run on Linux/Solaris/etc. you need Python 2.7 installed, in addition to the CherryPy and Mako modules.

To install the dependencies using PIP (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), do the following:

$ pip cherrypy install
$ pip mako install

All other module dependencies, such as SQLite3, are included with Python.

To run SpiderFoot, simply execute sf.py from the directory you extracted SpiderFoot into:

$ python ./sf.py

Once executed, a web-server will be started, which by default will listen on 127.0.0.1:5001. You can then use the browser of your choice by browsing to http://127.0.0.1:5001. 

If you wish to make SpiderFoot accessible from another system, for example running it on a server and controlling it remotely, then you can specify an external IP to bind to:

$ python ./sf.py 0.0.0.0:5001

Likewise, if port 5001 is used by another application on your system, you can change the port:

$ python ./sf.py 127.0.0.1:9999

** A word of caution **: SpiderFoot does not authenticate users connecting to it's user-interface (feature coming soon..), so avoid running it on a server/workstation that can be accessed from untrusted devices, as they will be able to control SpiderFoot remotely and initiate scans from your devices.
